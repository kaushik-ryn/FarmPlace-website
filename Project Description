FarmConnect - Connecting Farmers and Consumers Directly ðŸŒ¾ðŸ’»

FarmConnect is a web platform designed to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers, eliminating the need for middlemen. This initiative empowers farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers, ensuring better pricing for both parties while promoting transparency and sustainability in the agricultural supply chain.

âœ¨ Features:

Seamless connection between farmers and consumers.
Transparent pricing and fair trade practices.
User-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.
ðŸš€ Hackathon Journey:
This project was my entry for the Smart Hackathon 2024. While Iâ€™m proud of what I accomplished, I see room for improvement and am motivated to refine and enhance the website further. This experience has been a stepping stone, and Iâ€™m excited to make FarmConnect even better in the future!

Feel free to explore the repository, provide feedback, or collaborate to take this project to the next level!
